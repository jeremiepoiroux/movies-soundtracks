# Movies' Soundtracks

In this repository, you will find a .csv file with 3279 movies, some information and their soundtrack. The initial data stems from the small MovieLens dataset "recommended for education and development" (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 
The soundtracks has been collected on IMDb. For instance, Toy Story's soundtrack is available at this URL: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/soundtrack.
The other information available in the .csv are : IMDb id, Title, Year, Director(s), Actors, Genre(s), Type, Countries, Languages and IMDb Rating. They have been collected through the OMDb API (https://www.omdbapi.com/).

You may also download the scrapping Python script, where data.csv is a file with, for each row, a title (Title column) and a soundtrack URL (Soundtrack_URL column).
I welcome any feedbacks :)
