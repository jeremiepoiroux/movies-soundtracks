# Movies' Soundtracks

## The dataset

In this repository, you will find a [.csv](https://github.com/jeremiepoiroux/movies-soundtracks/blob/main/ml_imdb_movies_soundtracks.csv) file with 11 131 movies, their soundtracks and some contextual information. The initial data stems from the "full" MovieLens dataset ["recommended for education and development"](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) with around 86 000 movies.  
The soundtracks has been collected on IMDb. For instance, Toy Story's soundtrack is available at this URL: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/soundtrack. Unfortunately, only 13% of the 86 000 movies of the MovieLens dataset have an IMDb soundtrack page.
The other information available in the .csv are: MovieLens Id, IMDb Id, Type, Title, Year, Directors, Actors, Genres, Languages, Countries and IMDb Rating. They have been collected through the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). 

Some basic stats about the dataset:

You may also download the [scrapping Python script](https://github.com/jeremiepoiroux/movies-soundtracks/blob/main/imbd-movies-soundtracks-scrapper.py), where data.csv is a file with, for each row, a title (Title column) and a soundtrack URL (Soundtrack_URL column).
I welcome any feedbacks :)
