# Movies' Soundtracks

In this repository, you will find a .csv file with 3279 movies, their soundtracks and some contextual information. The initial data stems from the small MovieLens dataset ["recommended for education and development"](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 
The soundtracks has been collected on IMDb. For instance, Toy Story's soundtrack is available at this URL: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/soundtrack.
The other information available in the .csv are : Movie id, IMDb id, Title, Year, Director(s), Actors, Genre(s), Type, Countries, Languages and IMDb Rating. They have been collected through the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

You may also download the scrapping Python script, where data.csv is a file with, for each row, a title (Title column) and a soundtrack URL (Soundtrack_URL column).
I welcome any feedbacks :)
