# Movies' Soundtracks

## The dataset

In this repository, you will find a .csv file with 11 131 movies, their soundtracks and some contextual information. The initial data stems from the "full" MovieLens dataset ["recommended for education and development"](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) with around 86 000 movies.  
The soundtracks has been collected on IMDb. For instance, Toy Story's soundtrack is available at this URL: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/soundtrack. Unfortunately, only 13% of the 86 000 movies of the MovieLens dataset have an IMDb soundtrack page.
The other information available in the .csv are: MovieLens Id, IMDb Id, Type, Title, Year, Directors, Actors, Genres, Languages, Countries and IMDb Rating. They have been collected through the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). 

Some basic stats about the dataset:
- It contains 98.8% of movies, 0.7% of series and 0.5% of series episodes. Therefore, we will still talk about movies hereafter;
- The average year of release of a movie is 1999. The median is 2001, the minimum 1928, the maximum 2023 and the SD is 9.68 years. 25% of the movies were released before 1995, 50% before 2001 and 75% before 2005;
- DIRECTORS
- ACTORS
- GENRES
- LANGUAGES
- COUNTRIES
- The average IMDb rating of a movie is 6.17/10. The median is 6.30, the minimum 1.40 and the maximum 9.4. 25% of the movies were rated less than 5.50, 50% less than 6.30 and 75% less than 7.0;


You may also download the scrapping Python script, where data.csv is a file with, for each row, a title (Title column) and a soundtrack URL (Soundtrack_URL column).
I welcome any feedbacks :)
